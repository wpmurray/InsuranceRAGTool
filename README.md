The intention of this project is to review and analyze 10-k financial statments from insurance companies using RAG.

This is going to be separated into 3 sections:

Extract most recent 10k Filings for TRV, PGR, CB, ALL using the SEC API (Limited by API Access)
Build RAG model to interpret filings
Front-end user interface to support interactions with the LLM.
